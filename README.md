## Another fork? Why?
No reason, i just want to add new features and themes while also adding features that the Ferrit team have respectfully declined to add. This is not intended to be used in replacement of ferrit. In fact, projectsegfault will keep running ferrit alongside this fork on another subdomain. This fork may stop getting updated at any time so use it at your own risk.
